  <p>Inline elements</p>
  <p>Inline elements simply take up the space defined by the tags that define the element rather than interrupting the flow of the content.

    An inline element does not begin on a new line and only takes up as much space as is required.
    
    An example of an inline element is an anchor (or link) tag <a></a>. You can put several links in a row, and they will display in a line.</p>
