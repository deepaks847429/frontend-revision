  <h1>advantage</h1>
  <p>Let’s understand the advantages of doctype in html. 

    Browser Compatibility: The DOCTYPE helps ensure that browsers render the page in the standard mode instead of quirks mode, leading to more consistent behavior across different browsers.
     
    Validation: It's pivotal for the validation of your code as it tells the validator which version of HTML to check against.
     
    Professionalism: Utilizing the DOCTYPE declaration is a hallmark of a professionally created website, adhering to standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</p>

    <h1>Disadvantage</h1>

    <p>Complexity in Older Versions: In earlier versions of HTML, DOCTYPE declarations were often long and complex, which could be confusing for beginners.
 
      Quirks Mode Risk: If omitted or incorrectly written, browsers might render pages in quirks mode, leading to inconsistent styling and behavior.
       
      Limited Functionality: Beyond specifying the HTML version, the DOCTYPE doesn’t offer any additional functionality or features.</p>
